# ValidYTURLGen
Generates Public YouTube Video URLs using Javascript and actually validates them using the Google Cloud YouTube Data API V3.

This was a stupid joke that generates YouTube URLs, sends them to the Google Cloud YouTube API, validates them then lists valid ones on a public facing website.

This is currently running on a web server @ https://validyturlgen.reiyua.lol

This is pretty much impossible to get a working URL due to the fact there are 64^11 video ID's out there, but this is just for fun...

A great video discussing this is by Tom Scott "Will YouTube Ever Run Out Of Video IDs?" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gocwRvLhDf8

Thanks to @SpiritAxolotl for creating the code from line 11 to line 21 which actually completes the mathematical equations to generate the video IDs.
